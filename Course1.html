                <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language widely used for web development. It adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites, allowing you to create interactive forms, handle user events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and much more.</p>
                
                <p>JavaScript can be included in HTML documents using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. You can place the script tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section or at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section. Inline scripts can also be used by adding the <code>on*</code> attribute to HTML elements to trigger JavaScript code when specific events occur.</p>
                
                <p>JavaScript provides a wide range of functionalities and features. It supports variables, data types, operators, loops, conditional statements, functions, objects, and more. You can use JavaScript to manipulate the content and appearance of your webpages, validate forms, handle user input, perform calculations, make HTTP requests, and interact with APIs.</p>
                
                <p>Frameworks and libraries built on top of JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, further enhance its capabilities and simplify web development. These frameworks provide reusable components, state management, routing, and other advanced features to build complex web applications.</p>
                
                <p>As a web developer, having a solid understanding of JavaScript is essential for creating interactive and dynamic websites. It is a versatile language that continues to evolve, with new features and improvements being introduced regularly.</p>
