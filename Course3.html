                <h2>Introduction to Web Design and CSS</h2>
                <p>Web design is the process of creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. It involves planning and arranging elements such as layout, colors, typography, and images to achieve an aesthetically pleasing and effective design.</p>
                
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a key technology in web design. It allows you to control the presentation and styling of HTML elements. With CSS, you can define styles for fonts, colors, backgrounds, margins, padding, and more.</p>
                
                <p>CSS works by selecting HTML elements using selectors and applying styles to those elements. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. CSS styles can be defined inline using the <code>style</code> attribute, embedded within HTML using the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, or placed in an external CSS file and linked to the HTML using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.</p>
                
                <p>Web design principles such as visual hierarchy, balance, contrast, and white space help create harmonious and easy-to-read designs. It's important to consider factors like usability, accessibility, and responsiveness to ensure your website works well across different devices and browsers.</p>
                
                <p>With CSS, you can control the layout of elements using techniques like floats, flexbox, and CSS grid. These layout options allow you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation provide pre-defined styles and components, making it easier to create consistent and responsive web designs.</p>
                
                <p>Mastering CSS is crucial for web designers as it enables them to bring their creative vision to life and create engaging and visually appealing websites.</p>
